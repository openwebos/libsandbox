libsandbox
===========

Summary
-------
libsandbox is a collection of APIs for separating running programs.


Dependencies
============

Below are the tools and libraries (and their minimum versions) required to build libsandbox:

- cmake (version required by openwebos/cmake-modules-webos)
- g++ 4.6.3
- make (any version)
- openwebos/cmake-modules-webos 1.0.0 RC2

How to Build on Linux
=====================

## Building

Once you have downloaded the source, enter the following to build it (after
changing into the directory under which it was downloaded):

    $ mkdir BUILD
    $ cd BUILD
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

The directory under which the files are installed defaults to <tt>/usr/local/webos</tt>.
You can install them elsewhere by supplying a value for <tt>WEBOS\_INSTALL\_ROOT</tt>
when invoking <tt>cmake</tt>. For example:

    $ cmake -D WEBOS_INSTALL_ROOT:PATH=$HOME/projects/openwebos ..
    $ make
    $ make install

will install the files in subdirectories of <tt>$HOME/projects/openwebos</tt>.

Specifying <tt>WEBOS\_INSTALL\_ROOT</tt> also causes <tt>pkg-config</tt> to look
in that tree first before searching the standard locations. You can specify
additional directories to be searched prior to this one by setting the
<tt>PKG\_CONFIG\_PATH</tt> environment variable.

If not specified, <tt>WEBOS\_INSTALL\_ROOT</tt> defaults to <tt>/usr/local/webos</tt>.

To configure for a debug build, enter:

    $ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug ..

To see a list of the make targets that <tt>cmake</tt> has generated, enter:

    $ make help

## Uninstalling

From the directory where you originally ran <tt>make install<tt>, enter:

    $ [sudo] make uninstall

You will need to use <tt>sudo</tt> if you did not specify <tt>WEBOS\_INSTALL\_ROOT</tt>.
